# LC-Trie, Level Compressed Tries for IPv4 Subnet Matching

This project provides a level compressed trie C library
for the purposes of matching IP addresses to arbitrarily
define IPv4 CIDR subnets.  Various address types are
supported, and the library has the RFC 1918 private IPv4
address space as well as the remaining RFC 5735 special
IPv4 address ranges hard coded into an auxiliary IPv4
information module.

For our purposes, it should be sufficient to dump the trie
and start from scratch again if we want to rebuild the trie.
This will correspond to a front/back buffer should this need
to be wired into a performance critical asynchronous system.

## Instructions

### How to Build

Build requirements:
make, GCC, glibc, pcre

To build:
On any relatively modern unix system, simply typing make should
produce the lctrie_test executable binary.

### How to Run

./lctrie_test bgp/data-raw-table

This will use the raw APNIC BGP prefix table, run some basic
tests against the library, and then conduct a 5 second performance
test against the library with randomized lookup addresses.

Performance metrics and runtime stastics will be produced at the
end of each runtime step.
